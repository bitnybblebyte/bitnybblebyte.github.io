      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of Bit.Nybble.Byte (BNB) is to provide an environment for students to expand their knowledge in Java based software design past the material covered by the programming courses offered in the school curriculum. The content covered in the school curriculum is ideal for students that are just being introduced to Java based software design, whereas BNB would provide more challenging opportunities for students with supplementary experience. These opportunities would primarily revolve around the building of real world applications with a group of equally skilled programmers.
